        <h2>Reason To Vote</h2> 
        <p>I think Nba youngboy should be a presidental figure becuase he is someone to loom up too in life he shows that even if u take the wrong route through life you could alwyas have a road to stardum and he alwys shows jail wont hold you down it is only a sign that you have to do right in life and with his children he has shown that in his life,18-year-old rapper YoungBoy Never Broke Again has sullied his career early on because of his legal issues. After dropping out of high school in 9th grade and being placed in a juvenile detention center for committing robbery, the mercurial star has struggled to gain the proper footing needed to stay out of trouble I don’t think they really target, but if you got a name, they know who you is," he told the hip-hop publication. "You do something, they gonna come get you, and whoever you’re with and whatever they do, you’re accountable for it just because you got the biggest name. That’s how that shit go." During his stint in jail, YoungBoy released including "Win or Lose" and "Don't Matter."</p>
